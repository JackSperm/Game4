This game was the first one I ever made by myself.

The code is pretty ugly-I was 16, so yeah.

In this game, you're the red circle (I know, I'm obsessed with circles).

You chase this green ball—basically you eat it or something, and it teleports to a random location on the screen.

There’s a maximum of eight squares that spawn in random locations, and they change positions with each point you acquire.

I had a really rough time with squares spawning on top of the player while you were moving around, so I added a procedure called spawnkill that moves a square somewhere else if it accidentally spawns on top of you.
Now that I’m a bit wiser, I realize I probably overdid my solution to that problem.
